How to run the simulator


1. Download all test cases files along with sim.py

2. Open Terminal

3. Locate the folder where you saved the test case files and sim.py using Linux commands (e.g. cd)

4. Mark project file executable by typing 

                      chmod u+x simcache.py 
 
    into Terminal

5 To run the simulator along with test cases, type

                ./simcache.py test_file_name.bin --cache •,•,•

   into Terminal where test_file_name is the name of the file you wish to test (eg. array-sum) and • are cache configurations

   NOTE: The test_file_name and cache configuration are already displayed in the .s file underneath "EXECUTION OUTPUT" so a simple copy-and-paste will suffice
